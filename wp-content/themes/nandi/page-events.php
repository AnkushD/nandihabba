                    <p class="n-event-info">
                        Do you find history fascinating? Then you will love the Nandi Heritage Walk. An ancient fortress of Tipu Sultan, temples designed by the artistic Chola empire and more – this region is adorned with relics and monuments that celebrate a bygone era. Led by local and Bengaluru based historians, these walks are themed around Cornwallis & Tipu: The Sultan & the British in Battle, Ancient Bhoganandishwara Temple – India’s Centuries Old Heritage Meets Modernity and Nandi Hills Summit: The Legacy of a Hill Fortress. These walks narrate history with a local flavour and emphasise on the micro-history of the Nandi Hills and how it interplays with large historical themes.

Conducted in two stages, this contest is open to all secondary school students from Bangalore. The preliminary quiz round will be conducted at a select location in Bangalore, through a moderated written round. The quiz will test students’ general knowledge about Nandi Hills, Chickaballapur district and history, nature and wildlife of Bengaluru. The final round of the event will be held at Nandi Habba.
