                    <p class="n-event-info">
                        The first vague idea of Nandi Habba started coming together in 2016. UWBe was exploring different facets of Nandi Hills region and wanted to conduct a massive plantation drive along the path leading to the hills to restore the local ecology. This exploration led to a unanimous consensus that there is more to Nandi Hills than just the sunrise. UWBe felt the need to change people’s perspective of Nandi and establish the region as a heritage site. Thus, Nandi Habba was born.
